# DeltaClicker
Open source CLI (Planned to change) based autoclicker that makes use of mouse side buttons, to make it comfortable for pvp's, shooters or games that requires your hand to be always on your mouse!



## Features

* Side buttons correspond to LMB and RMB, which could be reversed.
* Inconsistency mode. Allows you to set offset between each click to emulate people's inconsistant clicking.
* Brand new WinUi3 based GUI to improve user`s expirience !



## To do.
- [x] Make an "Inconsistency mode".
- [x] Make UI version.
- [X] Make CLI x GUI . So people could choose between.
